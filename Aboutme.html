            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p> My name is Laura Mullings, or if you are a mandarin speaker, my name is 嘉丽. I am 20 years old, and I
                have always had a deep interest and passion for AI and software. I have always had an ambition to
                inspire those around me and prove to myself over and over that I am capable. I enjoy working with others
                and every person I meet whether through good circumstances or bad will always be a blessing in my life.
                There is a deep significance to me to representing my cultures and also representing my best self for
                others. I want to thank you for your time, thank you for taking a moment to get to know a little more
                about me and my background, although it is never mandatory.
            </p>
            <p> I had my introduction to Computer Science and Software Engineering at age 12 when I made my very first
                game. Since then I have taken a deep interest in machine learning and designing neural netowrks. I have
                researched countless ways to do image recognition, natural language processing and I have recently
                gotten
                into prompt engineering for some of my for-fun projects (not yet listed). To me, computer science is a
                way to express
                creativity within the applications of solving problems to serve humanity. It is always important to me
                that everything I do is executed well, efficiently and by the ethical standards thatt all software
                developers should adhere to. As the industry continues to change, so will I. I enjoy the newest
                developments and I hope to find myself caught up fully in due time. </p>
